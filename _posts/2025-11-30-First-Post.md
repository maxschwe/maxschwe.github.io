# 👋 Hi there

This is my first blog post. I am exited to start this journey and share my personal projects and learnings.

My first project will be to write at best daily blog posts about a country in the world. This is part of my idea to get to know countries and their history better and understand things happening in the world. At first i will be focusing on the [193 states part of the UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_United_Nations) and then maybe continue with other parts of the world.

Also i want to develop an app for a hide and seek game in real life, where the hunters get gps pings of the players every 5 minutes or so. The hiders should be able to use public transport but only in a limited manner and they can only get tickets by playing challenges. The exact details still need to be identified. More on that in later posts.

So thats it with my first post which i want to end it with one of the most beautiful equations in maths, incorporating many of the basic units in mathematics:

$$
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
$$
